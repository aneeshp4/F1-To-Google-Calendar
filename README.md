These scripts add all the confirmed Formula 1 events for a year into a user's google calendar.

Just run the "googleCalAdder.py" script to get this done. This will require 2 other JSON files though, one for the credentials for the Google Calendar as an API, and another for the Sportradar API's key. The Sportradar API does not strictly require a JSON, but I chose to include it in an API, so I didn't have to keep it in the python file.
